# James Hockless Ascensor Assessment

Welcome to my webpage! 

Unfortunately I was unable to complete every task within the timeframe given due to never using PHP or Wordpress before. However, I managed to get the majority done including the custom FAQ posts, the main theme styling (fonts/images/layout), working links/pagination, footer, header and more. 


# To complete:

- Responsive design for mobile use.

- Shortcode that allows users to switch between single column or two column grid.

- Shortcode that allows the users to specify individual post ID's.

- Dynamic admin options that places the information throughout the page.

- Some styling tasks (image not wrapped with text, FAQ title not styled)
